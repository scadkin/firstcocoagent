## YOU ARE HERE → C4: Cold License Requests — Spot-Check Accuracy (Session 35 paused here)

---

## CURRENT FOCUS: C4 Cold License Requests

### What C4 is
Cold license requests are inbound prospects who requested a CodeCombat license through Outreach sequences but Steven never connected with them — no opportunity was created, no pricing was sent. These are warm leads that went cold. Strategy label: `cold_license_request`.

### Why we're doing it
These are the lowest-hanging fruit for re-engagement. They already showed interest by requesting a license. Steven just needs to reach back out.

### How it works
The `/c4` command scans 3 Outreach license request sequences (IDs 507, 1768, 1860), pulls all prospects, then filters through multiple layers:
1. Student email exclusion ("student" in domain)
2. Active customer check (already in Active Accounts)
3. Existing queue check (already in Prospecting Queue)
4. Existing opp check (Pipeline or Closed Lost)
5. International email TLD exclusion
6. State extraction from email domain (k12, .gov, state abbreviations, city names)
7. SF data-driven domain→state lookup (built from real SF Leads/Contacts emails)
8. Territory matching against NCES data (email_priority=True)
9. Claude Sonnet batch inference for remaining unknowns
10. SoCal domain check for CA prospects (KNOWN_SOCAL_DOMAIN_ROOTS)
11. Pricing detection via bulk mailing scan (PandaDoc links, subject lines)

Surviving prospects are added to the Prospecting Queue with email, first name, last name visible.

### C4 Sub-tasks

| 14 | Column migration (16→19 cols) | ✅ Done (Session 35) | `/fix_queue`, `/cleanup_queue` commands |
| 15 | Spot-check accuracy of states | 🔧 In progress | ← PAUSED HERE. Last /c4 run: 1,452 targets, 228 Claude inferred. Steven has not yet spot-checked this run. |
| 16 | Spot-check SoCal exclusions | ⬜ Not started | Check C4 Audit tab OUT OF TERRITORY section |
| 17 | Final verification + sign-off | ⬜ Not started | Steven reviews, confirms results are clean |

### Mid-flight additions to C4 (things that came up during implementation)
- **Prospecting Queue column redesign** — added Email, First Name, Last Name columns so contact info isn't buried in Notes. Required migrating all existing rows from 16→19 columns.
- **`/fix_queue` and `/cleanup_queue` commands** — needed to fix data after column migration issues.
- **Comprehensive state extraction** — original plan was just territory matching + Claude. Spot-checking revealed email domains like `k12.va.us`, `harmonytx.org`, `schools.nyc.gov` weren't being parsed for state info. Built a multi-pattern extractor.
- **SF data-driven domain lookup** — hardcoded abbreviation lists weren't enough. Built a system that reads real email→state pairs from SF Leads/Contacts to learn domain mappings automatically.
- **Known SoCal domain list** — territory matcher's generated roots missed creative abbreviations like `sandi` (San Diego), `ggusd` (Garden Grove), `myabcusd` (ABC USD). Added 90+ known roots.
- **CLAUDE.md trimming** — file grew past 40k char limit (impacts Claude Code performance). Trimmed to 29k, moved detailed history to `docs/SESSION_HISTORY.md`.

## FULL ROADMAP

### Part A: Quick Wins — ALL DONE (Session 23)

| # | Enhancement | What it does | Status |
|---|------------|-------------|--------|
| A1 | `/call_list [N]` custom count | Parse optional number, clamp 1-50, default 10 | ✅ Done |
| A2 | Command cheat sheet in morning brief | `_COMMAND_CHEAT_SHEET` appended to morning brief | ✅ Done |
| A3 | Color-code lead rows by confidence | Auto-colors after research. VERIFIED=green, LIKELY=yellow-green, INFERRED=yellow, UNKNOWN=grey | ✅ Done |

### Part B: Medium Features — ALL DONE (Sessions 23-30)

| # | Enhancement | What it does | Status |
|---|------------|-------------|--------|
| B1 | Weekend scheduler | Sat 11am, Sun 1pm greeting. No auto check-ins. `/eod` for manual EOD. | ✅ Done |
| B2 | SF Leads/Contacts import + enrichment | Import Salesforce lead/contact CSVs. Cross-check against Active Accounts. Math filter tabs. Serper enrichment. Separate Google Sheet. | ✅ Done (verified Session 30, 8/8 tests) |

**B2 mid-flight additions:**
- Sessions 25-26: SoCal CSV filtering scripts (5 passes, offline, needed for real data testing)
- Session 27: Merged territory CSV files (86k leads + 20k contacts)
- Sessions 27-28: Cross-check rule refinement (school vs district matching rules clarified by Steven)

### Part C: Large Projects

| # | Enhancement | What it does | Status |
|---|------------|-------------|--------|
| C1 | Territory Master List | NCES CCD data for 13 states + SoCal. 8,133 districts, 40,317 schools. Gap analysis. | ✅ Done (Sessions 31-32) |
| C3 | Closed-Lost Winback | Scan closed-lost opps, add to Prospecting Queue. Date window filtering. Draft sequences. | ✅ Done (Sessions 33-34, verified) |
| C4 | Cold License Requests | Scan Outreach sequences for cold inbound requests. Territory matching + state extraction. | 🔧 In progress (Sessions 34-35) |
| C2 | Research Engine Improvements | Parallelize layers, better prompts, Claude tool_use. Est. 2-3 sessions. | ⬜ Next after C4 |
| C5 | Proximity + Regional Service Centers | Go after schools near active accounts. ESC/BOCES mapping. | ⬜ Deferred |

**Note:** C4 was originally described as "Unresponsive leads strategy" in the roadmap but evolved during implementation into "Cold License Requests" — specifically targeting inbound license requests from Outreach sequences that went cold (no opp, no pricing). This is a more focused and actionable definition than generic "unresponsive leads." The original C4 concept of tracking outbound attempts + non-response may still be built later as a separate feature.

### Unplanned Work (things that came up between roadmap items)

| When | What | Why |
|------|------|-----|
| Sessions 25-26 | SoCal CSV filtering (5-pass offline scripts) | Needed to filter 20k+ SoCal leads/contacts before B2 could use real data |
| Session 27 | Merged territory CSV creation | Combined SoCal + non-SoCal lead/contact files for complete dataset |
| Session 34 | Prospecting Queue column redesign | C4 needed email/name columns visible, not buried in Notes |
| Session 35 | CLAUDE.md trimming + SESSION_HISTORY.md | Performance warning at 41.9k chars. Moved detailed history to separate file. |
| Session 35 | `/fix_queue`, `/cleanup_queue` commands | Column migration from 16→19 created data alignment issues |

## UP NEXT (after C4 is verified)

### C2: Research Engine Improvements
**What:** Make the district research engine faster and more accurate.
- **Quick win:** Parallelize independent research layers (L1-5 concurrently, L11-14 concurrently) — est. 40-60% time reduction
- **Medium:** Better Claude extraction prompts with few-shot examples for higher accuracy
- **Advanced:** Claude tool_use for interactive, adaptive extraction
- **Estimated effort:** 2-3 sessions

### C5: Proximity + Regional Service Centers (deferred)
**What:** Two related prospecting strategies:
1. **Proximity:** Go after schools/districts physically near active accounts. Name drop existing customers, lean into FOMO.
2. **Regional service centers:** Map ESC/BOCES/IU names (different name in every state) to find districts through their service center relationships.
- **Depends on:** C1 (done — territory data with lat/lon), geocoding
- **Estimated effort:** TBD

## PARKED FOR LATER (Steven asked to revisit at a future time)

### Sequence Copy Improvements
- Outreach.io variables not being used — sequences have hardcoded names instead of `{{first_name}}`, `{{company}}`, `{{state}}` etc.
- Product accuracy in sequences: **AI Junior = still in beta (NOT released)**, AI Algebra = launched (reference as new offering), CyberSecurity course = planned fall 2026 (can say "coming soon")
- Inaccurate product claims in sequences damage credibility
- **When:** After C4 is done, when we next build/edit sequences

### Fuzzy Matching for Territory Cross-Check
- Territory school→district lookup currently uses exact normalized name matching
- Only 17 out of ~93 schools matched their parent district (very low hit rate)
- NCES and Salesforce spell school names differently (e.g., "Huntington Beach High School" vs "Huntington Beach Senior High School")
- **Fix needed:** Levenshtein distance, token overlap, or substring matching. Could also try city+state+school-type as secondary lookup.
- Would improve Parent District values for winback and C4 targets
- **When:** Future enhancement, could be folded into C2 research engine improvements

### Active Accounts Column Rename
- "Display Name" → "Active Account Name" in the Google Sheet header
- Will happen automatically on next account CSV import (csv_importer rewrites header)
- Until then, all code reading Active Accounts must check BOTH column names
- **When:** Automatic on next CSV import — no action needed

### Automate Sequence Creation for C4 Prospects
- Once C4 is verified and producing clean results, automate building outreach sequences for the cold license request prospects
- Would connect C4 scan → sequence builder → Google Doc draft
- **When:** After C4 is fully verified and producing clean, trusted results

### Original C4 Concept: Track Outbound Non-Response
- The original roadmap described C4 as "unresponsive leads" — tracking outbound contact attempts + detecting non-response
- We redefined C4 to focus on cold license requests (more specific and actionable)
- The broader "contacted 30+ days ago, no reply detected" concept could still be built as a separate feature
- Would need activity tracking to distinguish sent vs replied
- **When:** TBD, after current C4 and C2 are done
