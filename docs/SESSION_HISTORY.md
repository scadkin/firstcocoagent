## Session 35 (2026-03-23/25) — C4 Spot-Check Fixes + State Extraction + Plan Infrastructure

### Session Summary
Fixed all 5 C4 spot-check issues from Session 34 (email domain priority, SoCal detection, student exclusion, Claude prompt, lead-level columns). Built comprehensive state extraction from email domains (k12, .gov, state suffixes, city names). Built SF data-driven domain→state lookup from real SF Leads/Contacts emails. Added Prospecting Queue column migration (16→19 cols), /fix_queue, /cleanup_queue commands. Trimmed CLAUDE.md from 43.6k→28.9k for performance. Created SCOUT_PLAN.md as living master plan and docs/SESSION_HISTORY.md as detailed history. Paused mid-spot-check — latest /c4 run produced 1,452 targets, Steven needs to review accuracy.

### Key Decisions
- Email domain always ranks higher than company name for location (email_priority=True)
- Build domain→state mapping from real SF data rather than hardcoded lists
- Don't exclude unknown-state prospects yet — keep in queue for review until confident
- SCOUT_PLAN.md maintained as detailed living plan, brief view shown in terminal
- CLAUDE.md kept lean (under 40k combined), SESSION_HISTORY.md has full details

### Feedback Captured
- Always ask for Steven's input before implementing fixes
- Always give exact next steps (no dev jargon)
- Always acknowledge Steven's points before jumping to action
- Never tell Steven to push/deploy — always do it yourself
- Plan brief view should be moderately detailed, not too short
- Keep comprehensive records — Steven should never have to remember what he told Claude

### Detailed Implementation Notes (Session 35)

### C4 Issues Found During Spot-Check
1. **Email domain must rank higher than company name** — Salesforce company names are unreliable (educators pick wrong school when signing up). Example: `mstewart2@udallas.edu` with "Corsica High School" → should be TX not SD.
2. **Known SoCal domains excluded incorrectly** — `lausd.net`, `sandi.net`, `ucsd.edu`, `aesd.net` are SoCal but excluded as "CA - not in SoCal territory". Must check email domain against territory districts before excluding CA.
3. **Claude prompt needs email domain emphasis** — Tell Claude: "email domain is the MOST reliable signal."
4. **Student emails must be excluded** — `students.` subdomain = student, not educator. Also `waltonstudent.org`, `cusdstudent.com` etc.
5. **Need lead-level columns** — C4 prospects need email, first name, last name visible (not buried in Notes).

### Fixes Applied
- `match_record()` gets `email_priority=True` param — email domain matching runs BEFORE name matching
- `_match_by_email_domain()` extracted as reusable helper
- Claude inference prompt explicitly states email domain is MOST reliable signal with examples
- `is_student_email()`: detects "student" anywhere in domain (not just prefix)
- Email, First Name, Last Name columns added to Prospecting Queue (19 columns total)
- Prospecting Queue column migration from 16→19 columns (`migrate_prospect_columns()`)
- `/fix_queue` and `/cleanup_queue` commands added

### Comprehensive State Extraction (extract_state_from_email)
Patterns checked in order:
1. k12.STATE.us or k12.STATE.gov (any length, handles DC)
2. *.STATE.us with edu markers
3. State abbreviation as suffix of domain root (harmonytx → TX)
4. State abbreviation after separator (acs-nj → NJ)
5. State name in domain (hawaii.edu → HI)
6. Known city in domain (schools.nyc.gov → NY, udallas.edu → TX via dallas)

Ambiguous suffixes excluded from suffix matching: sd, id, in, me, or, al

### Known SoCal Domain Roots (KNOWN_SOCAL_DOMAIN_ROOTS)
90+ hardcoded SoCal district abbreviations that can't be derived from NCES names:
lausd, sandi, sausd, ggusd, abcusd, myabcusd, iusd, tustin, capousd, svusd, fjuhsd, auhsd, pylusd, bousd, hbuhsd, lbusd, musd, cnusd, cjusd, mvusd, psusd, rusd, ausd, jusd, alvord, hemet, menifee, beaumont, banning, perris, rialto, fontana, colton, redlands, yucaipa, sbcusd, and many more.

### Bug Fixes
- `extract_domain_root()`: fixed `parts[-2]` → `parts[-1]` for k12 TLD detection
- `extract_domain_root()`: fixed multi-level handler `parts[:-2]` → `parts[:-1]` (was missing lausd in staff.lausd.net)
- `generate_domain_roots()`: added acronym+sd/usd variants (lausd, ggusd, sdusd)
- C4 row building: `first_name`/`last_name` were not in `filtered_candidates` tuple — caused crash
- Timing message updated from "15-20 min" to "~10 min"

### Still In Progress
- Building domain→state mapping from real SF Leads/Contacts/Territory data
- Many prospects still have empty states — need data-driven approach

## Session 34 (2026-03-20) — C3 Verified, Outreach Connected, C4 Built

### C3 Closed-Lost Winback — FULLY VERIFIED
All 5 tests passed: import, scan, spot-check, approve+research, sequence draft.
- Date window logic: dual-edge `buffer_months=6` + `lookback_months=18`
- `/prospect_winback all` disables both. Custom params: `buffer=N lookback=N`

### Outreach.io API Integration
- OAuth app: "AI Coco Automation" (Development mode), shared with CodeCombat team
- Steven's Outreach user ID: **11** — all queries filter by this owner ID
- Tokens persist via GitHub (`memory/outreach_tokens.json`) — survives Railway deploys
- `/connect_outreach [force]` — OAuth flow, sends auth link in Telegram
- `/outreach_status` — shows connection status + user ID
- `/outreach_sequences` — lists Steven's sequences with engagement stats
- Read-only scopes: accounts, prospects, sequences, sequenceStates, sequenceSteps, sequenceTemplates, templates, mailings, calls, events, users, callDispositions
- **NEVER write to Outreach** — read-only. Don't add write operations without Steven's explicit approval.

### C4 Cold License Request Scan — Built End-to-End
- Pulls prospects from 3 US license request sequences (507, 1768, 1860)
- Bulk mailing scan for pricing detection (PandaDoc + subject + body content)
- Territory matcher (5-tier fuzzy matching against NCES data)
- Claude Sonnet batch inference for unresolved locations
- International TLD exclusion
- Cross-check against Active Accounts, Pipeline, Closed Lost
- Strategy: "cold_license_request", Source: "outreach"
- Scan takes ~10 min (bulk mailing + Claude inference)
- Initial results: 1,290 targets from 2,118 prospects (after all filters)

### territory_matcher.py Created
- Core utility for matching messy school/district names against NCES Territory Master List
- 5-tier matching: exact name, suffix-stripped, email domain, city+token overlap, containment
- In-memory cache with 1-hour TTL (~48K records from Territory Schools + Districts tabs)
- `match_record(name, email=, city=, state=, email_priority=)` → MatchResult or None
- `match_records(records, ...)` → batch matching with email_priority support
- `infer_locations_with_claude(unknowns)` → Claude batch inference for unresolved
- `extract_domain_root(email)` and `generate_domain_roots(name)` — domain utilities
- `extract_state_from_email(email)` — comprehensive state extraction
- `is_student_email(email)` — student detection
- `is_socal_domain(email)` — SoCal district domain detection

### Prospecting Queue Redesigned
New column order (19 columns):
State | Account Name | Email | First Name | Last Name | Deal Level | Parent District | Name Key | Strategy | Source | Status | Priority | Date Added | Date Approved | Sequence Doc URL | Est. Enrollment | School Count | Total Licenses | Notes (always last)

### New Commands
`/connect_outreach [force]`, `/outreach_status`, `/outreach_sequences`, `/c4` (also `/prospect_cold_requests`, `/cold_requests`), `/c4_clear`, `/fix_queue`, `/cleanup_queue`

### Speed Optimization
- Bulk mailing scan (3 API calls vs 1,600+)
- Background task execution for C4 scan

## Session 33 (2026-03-19) — C3 Closed-Lost Winback Built

### C3 Design Decisions
- **Data source:** Separate Salesforce "Closed Lost Opportunities" report CSV — NOT from Pipeline tab
- **Closed-lost opps are not in Steven's pipeline data.** He must run a dedicated report in Salesforce, export CSV, upload to Scout
- `/import_closed_lost` — sets next CSV upload to route to the "Closed Lost" tab (dedicated, separate from Pipeline)
- Natural language: "closed lost" / "winback" in caption or pre-message also routes to Closed Lost tab
- `get_closed_lost_opps()` reads from Closed Lost tab first, falls back to Pipeline tab
- Filter: Date window with dual edges — `buffer_months=6` (exclude too-recent) + `lookback_months=18` (how far back from buffer edge). Default: ~24mo ago to ~6mo ago. `lookback_months=0` = no oldest cutoff.
- Groups by district: uses Parent Account if available, else Account Name
- Priority 550-749: higher deal amounts score higher. Between upward (600-999) and cold (300-700)
- Notes field captures: opp count, total value, last close date, opp names

### Winback Sequence Requirements
- 5 steps, Outreach.io variables ({{first_name}}, {{state}}, {{company}})
- At least one "reply" email
- Highlight what's new/improved
- Include incentivization
- Breakup email last

### Why Deals Close Lost (Actual Data)
- 61% Unresponsive (teacher went dark after admin pushback)
- 19% Budget (admin said no)
- 5% Not using/didn't start
- 4% Teacher turnover
- 2% Competitor
- Teachers get discouraged asking admins

---

## Sessions 31-32 — C1 Territory Master List

### Implementation Details
- Data source: Urban Institute Education Data API (`educationdata.urban.org`), wrapping NCES CCD 2023
- No auth required, JSON responses, filter by FIPS state code
- 13 states: IL, PA, OH, MI, CT, OK, MA, IN, NV, TN, NE, TX + CA (SoCal counties only)
- CA filtered by `county_code` to 10 SoCal counties — **API returns county_code as strings** (e.g., `"6037"`), not integers
- Separate Google Sheet: `GOOGLE_SHEETS_TERRITORY_ID` env var (falls back to main sheet)
- Two tabs: `Territory Districts` (17 columns) and `Territory Schools` (18 columns)
- API responses cached in `/tmp/territory_{kind}_{state}.json` with 7-day TTL (cleared on Railway redeploy)
- Sync clears existing rows for each state before writing (idempotent re-sync)
- Chunked writes at 2,000 rows with 3-attempt retry
- **Full territory size:** 8,133 districts, 40,317 schools, 20.6M students across all states

### Gap Analysis Coverage Rules
- District-level Active Account deal = "covered"
- School account in a district = "upward opportunity" (NOT coverage)
- Coverage % = district deals / total NCES districts
- Unmatched schools (private/charter not in NCES) shown separately with warning

---

## Sessions 24-28 — B2 SF Leads & Contacts Import

### Design
- Two new tabs: **SF Leads** (from Salesforce Leads report) and **SF Contacts** (from Salesforce Contacts report)
- SEPARATE from the existing Leads tab (which is research-generated contacts)
- `/import_leads` — next CSV goes to SF Leads tab; `/import_contacts` — next CSV goes to SF Contacts tab
- Auto-detect: lead CSV has 2+ of {Lead Source, Lead Status, Company}; contact CSV has 2+ of {Account Name, Department, Contact Owner} + name columns
- Auto-detect priority: pipeline > sf_leads > sf_contacts > accounts
- Natural language: "salesforce leads" / "my leads" routes to SF Leads; "contacts" / "sf contacts" routes to SF Contacts

### Cross-Check Implementation
- Cross-checks each record against Active Accounts by email domain, account/company name, and district name
- Enrichment columns: Verified School, Verified District, Verified State, Verified County (CA only), Active Account Match, Enrichment Status, Enrichment Notes, Last Enriched, Date Imported
- **Exact Match - School**: lead's company = same school as active account → match
- **Exact Match - District**: lead's company = same district as active account → match
- **District is Active Account**: active account is a district-level deal, lead is at any school or the district itself → match
- **NOT a match**: active account is just a school, lead is at a DIFFERENT school or the district → Steven can freely prospect
- Key rule: school-level active accounts only block the SAME school. District-level active accounts block the whole district.

### Domain Matching
- Pre-built lookup structures: `_build_account_lookups()` runs once per import
- `_generate_domain_roots()` creates plausible roots from account names (e.g., "Austin ISD" → {"austinisd", "austin", "aisd"})
- Includes acronym-based roots: "Los Angeles Unified School District" → "lausd"
- `_extract_domain_root()` handles k12-style domains and multi-level domains
- State filtering: matches require same state (or either side blank)
- **Step 2 (District Name) validation**: Salesforce District Name field is unreliable — if lead has non-generic institutional email, domain root must match the matched district's generated roots.

### Tab Structure
- Two extra tabs: **Leads Assoc Active Accounts** and **Contacts Assoc Active Accounts**
- Four math filter tabs: **SF Leads - Math**, **Leads Assoc Active - Math**, **SF Contacts - Math**, **Contacts Assoc Active - Math**
- **Mutually exclusive routing** — each record goes to exactly ONE tab
- Separate Google Sheet: `GOOGLE_SHEETS_SF_ID` env var

### Technical Details
- Large CSV imports chunked at 2,000 rows per batch with 3-attempt retry + 2s/4s backoff
- Append range uses tight `A:{last_col}` based on header count (NOT `A:AZ`) — prevents 10M cell limit hits
- `clear_tab()` uses `values().clear()` + `updateSheetProperties` grid resize (NOT `deleteDimension` which fails on frozen rows)
- Tab formatting: column widths sized to header text (~7px/char), alternating row banding, frozen row 1
- Column order: State/Province first, then name/title/company/email, then Active Account Match right after Email
- "Leads from Research" — renamed from "Leads". `TAB_LEADS` constant in sheets_writer.py

## Sessions 25-26 — SoCal Lead/Contact Filtering (Offline Scripts)

### Scripts (in `scripts/` — NOT Scout feature code)
- `scripts/socal_filter.py` — Pass 1: CDE public school/district name matching + zip + city + email domain
- `scripts/socal_filter_pass2.py` — Pass 2: Parent account matching, city names embedded in school names, deeper email domain
- `scripts/socal_filter_pass3.py` — Pass 3: CDE + NCES private school database matching
- `scripts/socal_filter_pass4.py` — Pass 4: Serper web search on uncertain school-keyword records
- `scripts/socal_filter_pass5.py` — Pass 5: Free lookups (email domain→district→county, phone area codes, city/District Name fields)
- `scripts/socal_rebuild_leads.py` — Utility: replays passes 1-4 from original source

### Data Sources
- CDE public schools: `https://www.cde.ca.gov/schooldirectory/report?rid=dl1&tp=txt`
- CDE districts: `rid=dl2`
- CDE private: `https://www.cde.ca.gov/ds/si/ps/documents/privateschooldata2425.xlsx`
- NCES private: `https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/pss/zip/pss2122_pu_csv.zip`
- Cached in `/tmp/`

### Results
- Input: 20,737 SoCal leads + 8,040 SoCal contacts
- Output: 10,677 confirmed leads, 4,170 confirmed contacts, 1,128 uncertain leads, 69 uncertain contacts
- SoCal counties: Los Angeles, San Diego, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, Kern, Ventura, Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo, Imperial
- Salesforce CSV files use latin-1 encoding
- Pass order: 1→2→3→5→4 (pass 5 before 4 saves Serper credits)
- Serper credits used: ~819 total

### Merged Files (Session 27)
- `~/Downloads/My merged leads list - Including SoCal - as of 3-7-26.csv` — 86,993 leads
- `~/Downloads/My merged contacts list - Including SoCal - as of 3-7-26.csv` — 19,775 contacts

---

## Session 23 — Enhancements A1-A3 + B1

### Weekend Scheduler (B1)
- Saturday: greeting at 11:00am CST, Sunday: greeting at 1:00pm CST
- No auto check-ins or auto EOD on weekends
- `/eod` command triggers EOD report manually (works any day)
- `scheduler.mark_user_active_today()` called from `handle_message()` on weekends — suppresses auto-greeting if Steven messages first
- `_is_user_active_today()` resets daily (compares against current date)

### Lead Row Coloring (A3)
- `_color_leads_by_confidence()` auto-runs after `write_contacts()` appends to Leads tab
- `/color_leads` command recolors all existing rows (one-time cleanup)
- Colors: VERIFIED/HIGH = light green, LIKELY/MEDIUM = yellowish-green, INFERRED/LOW = light yellow, UNKNOWN = light grey
- Batches in chunks of 500 requests for Sheets API safety
