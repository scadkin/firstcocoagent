# SCOUT — Claude Code Reference
*Last updated: 2026-04-09 — End of Session 51*

---

## CURRENT STATE — update this after each session

**Session 51 (COMPLETE): Tier A spot-check + full Tier B/C build. Fixed F4+F2 source URL bug. Rewrote F2 scanner from scratch (BoardDocs + RFP queries, 7 real HIGH signals vs. Session 49's 7 noise). Shipped F5 CSTA Chapter Partnership, F6 Charter CMO seed list (43 CMOs / 918 schools), F7 CTE Center Directory (79 centers / 1009 sending districts), F8 Private School discovery + 24-network seed, F9 CS Graduation Compliance Gap PDF pilot (CA/IL/MA). 9 commits total.**

### Recent sessions (details in SCOUT_PLAN.md + SCOUT_HISTORY.md)
- **Session 51:** Tier B+C Lead Gen (F5/F6/F7/F8/F9/F10 all shipped), F4+F2 URL bug fix, F2 complete rewrite, Tier A spot-check verdict. 9 commits. Plan: session-of-execution (no formal plan file, followed Session 49 Tier B/C stubs).
- **Session 50:** Email drafter fixes: thread-aware drafting (GAS `getThreadsBulk` + Python enrichment), restart seeding notice, `/draft [name]` targeted command, skip-count UX. 4 commits. Plan: `/Users/stevenadkins/.claude/plans/sparkling-cooking-eclipse.md`
- **Session 49:** Email auto-drafter, 5 parked features, Lead Gen Tier A (F1 second buyer, F2 competitor, F3 curriculum adoption, F4 funding scanner). 16+ commits. Plan: `/Users/stevenadkins/.claude/plans/inherited-munching-sunrise.md`
- **Session 48:** Email Reply Drafting system — Gmail MCP threaded drafts in Steven's voice. Response playbook, voice profile updated, GAS `delete_draft`.
- **Session 47:** Territory map enriched popups + signal heat overlay. 6 new scanners (grants, budget, algebra, cyber, roles, CSTA). Lookalike, re-engagement, dormant detection.
- **Session 46:** Leadership/RFP/legislative scanners. Territory map visualization. BoardDocs noise filtering.
- **Session 45:** RSS + BoardDocs + Ballotpedia + signal attribution. 3 Outreach sequences. Send schedules.

### What still needs to be done (next session — start here)
1. **Act on Session 51 build outputs** — all the new scanners/prospectors are built but nothing has been queued or approved yet. Steven explicitly deferred acting. When ready:
   - Run `/prospect_charter_cmos` (or per-state) to queue the 43 charter CMOs, then approve in batches.
   - Run `/prospect_cte_centers` to queue the 79 CTE centers.
   - Run `/prospect_private_networks` to queue the 24 diocesan / chain networks.
   - Run `/scan_compliance CA`, `/scan_compliance IL`, `/scan_compliance MA` for F9 — this is the PILOT and needs validation before scaling. Goal: ≥60% of auto-queued districts should be verifiable non-compliant on manual spot-check.
   - Run `/signal_competitors` to rebuild F2 Signals tab with the new BoardDocs-sourced HIGH signals. Old Session 49 noise is still in the sheet and needs clearing or will dedup-block.
   - Run `/signal_funding` to rebuild F4 Signals tab with source URLs now captured.
   - Run `/signal_csta` to rebuild CSTA signals — now with URL + auto-queue of HIGH-confidence chapter leaders as `csta_partnership` strategy.
2. **Spot-check Tier A Session 49 outputs** (now possible with URLs):
   - Western Reserve ESC (OH) F4 result: REAL — confirmed via news-herald.com Teach CS 2.0 grant. $584K for teacher PD (not curriculum). Act on member districts Willoughby-Eastlake, Painesville, iSTEM — not the ESC directly.
   - F2 Carlinville/Effingham/U-46 (IL): WEAK — partner listings, not paid customers. Do not treat as displacement leads.
   - F2 Azusa USD (CA): VERY WEAK — one student won a CodeHS scholarship. Not district adoption.
3. **Approve F1 prospects in batches of 5-10** via `/prospect_approve` — 384 intra-district schools still queued from Session 49.
4. **Tulsa PS bond results** — Vote was April 7. If Prop 3 ($104M tech) passed, act on Robert F. Burton (Exec Dir IT).
5. **Verify Google Alert parser** — Run `/signal_scan` to confirm new digest with bond/leadership/AI policy keywords is parsed correctly.
6. **Act on 4 STRONG enriched signals** — Tulsa PS, Richardson ISD, Acton-Boxborough, Norwalk PS.
7. **Deferred:** #2 Usage-based prospecting (blocked on CodeCombat data), Firecrawl paid plan (budget), Parse.bot (DNS), F2 tertiary vendor case-study query (deleted in Session 51 — only re-add if BoardDocs+RFP proves insufficient).
8. See `SCOUT_PLAN.md` for full roadmap and `SCOUT_HISTORY.md` for detail.

### Current status
- All prior phases + enhancements: ✅
- Signal Intelligence System: ✅ — **22 sources** (Session 51 added F9 compliance_gap). **40+ Telegram commands** (Session 51 added `/scan_compliance`, `/prospect_charter_cmos`, `/prospect_cte_centers`, `/prospect_private_networks`, `/discover_coops`, `/discover_private_schools`, `/list_charter_cmos`, `/list_cte_centers`). Daily 7:45 AM + weekly Monday (leadership/RFP) + monthly 1st Monday (legislation/grants/budget). On-demand: roles, CSTA, algebra, cyber, funding, competitors, compliance.
- Prospecting strategies: ✅ **All Tier A + B + C strategies built** after Session 51. Session 51 added `csta_partnership`, `charter_cmo`, `cte_center`, `private_school_network`, `compliance_gap`, `homeschool_coop`. Session 49 added `intra_district`, `competitor_displacement`, `cs_funding_recipient`. Only #2 usage-based (blocked on CodeCombat data) remains unbuilt.
- Outreach sequences: ✅ — IDs 1995-2001 (C4 x4, License Request, Webinar x2). 3 send schedules.
- Email auto-drafter: ✅ — runs every 5 min during business hours, **thread-aware** (GAS `getThreadsBulk` batch fetch, STEVEN/PROSPECT attribution in prompt). Dedup via `threadHasDraft`. Manual triggers: `/draft_emails`, `/draft force`, `/draft [name]` (targeted, bypasses classification). Restart seeding notifies Telegram with `/draft force` hint.
- Sequence copy rules: ✅ — Comprehensive rules in memory. Seasonal calendar. Send schedules.

### Completed features (details in SCOUT_PLAN.md)
- **A3 Lead row coloring**, **B2 SF Leads/Contacts import**, **C1 Territory Master List**, **C3 Closed-Lost Winback**, **C4 Cold License Requests**, **C5 Proximity + ESA**, **SoCal CSV Filtering** — all verified and documented in SCOUT_PLAN.md.
- `lead_importer` is a flat module imported at top of main.py (NOT lazy). `clear_tab()` uses `values().clear()` + `updateSheetProperties` grid resize (NOT `deleteDimension`).
- "Leads from Research" = renamed research Leads tab. `TAB_LEADS` constant.
- Cross-check rules: school-level active accounts only block SAME school. District-level blocks whole district.

### Outreach.io API (key gotchas — full details in SCOUT_PLAN.md + memory)
- Steven's user ID: **11**. Write access for sequences/steps/templates/prospects only.
- **Interval is in SECONDS** (not minutes). 5 min=300, 4 days=345600, 6 days=518400.
- **`toRecipients` MUST be `[]` (empty).** Never `["{{toRecipient}}"]` — causes all emails to fail.
- Creation flow: create sequence → steps → templates → link → Steven activates in UI → THEN add prospects.
- Use `<br><br>` between paragraphs in bodyHtml, NOT `<p>` tags.
- Schedules: UI-only (no API scopes). Three standard: "Teacher Tue-Thu Multi-Window", "Admin Mon-Thurs Multi-Window", "Hot Lead Mon-Fri".
- C4 sequences: IDs 1995-1998. Schedule: "C4 Tue-Thu Morning" (ID 50). Steven's template: ID 43784.

### Email Reply Drafting (auto + manual)
**Auto-drafting (Railway):** `tools/email_drafter.py` polls unread inbox every 5 min during business hours (7 AM - 6 PM CST, weekdays). Classifies via Claude Haiku (DRAFT/FLAG/SKIP), drafts via Claude Sonnet with voice profile + playbook + **full thread history** (via `gas.get_threads_bulk`), creates threaded HTML drafts via GAS bridge. Notifies Steven in Telegram. Manual triggers: `/draft_emails`, `/draft force`, `/draft [name]` (targeted — bypasses classification).
**Claude Code workflow:** When Steven says "draft my emails" in Claude Code, load and follow `prompts/reply_draft.md`.
Voice rules in `memory/voice_profile.md`. Response patterns in `memory/response_playbook.md`.
Draft log in `memory/draft_log.md`. Known issue: Outreach browser extension strips draft body for contacts in Outreach.

---

### Session transcript capture
- Steven starts sessions with `scout` in terminal (not `claude`). This wraps Claude Code with `script` to capture full transcripts.
- Transcripts save to `docs/sessions/session_N.md`. Raw captures in `docs/sessions/.raw/` (gitignored).
- During end-of-session routine: run `python3 scripts/clean_transcript.py "$SCOUT_RAW_TRANSCRIPT" "$SCOUT_CLEAN_TRANSCRIPT"`, then include the clean file in the commit.
- Env vars available: `SCOUT_SESSION_NUM`, `SCOUT_RAW_TRANSCRIPT`, `SCOUT_CLEAN_TRANSCRIPT`.
- Steven uses `/exit` between sessions (not `/clear`) so each `scout` run = one transcript file.
- Wrapper script auto-commits as fallback if end-of-session routine is skipped.
- **Session numbering source of truth is CLAUDE.md header** (`Session N`). The `scout_session.sh` script parses this, transcript files on disk, and raw files — uses the highest. This prevents drift when sessions run without the `scout` wrapper.

---

## CRITICAL RULES

**Always push code changes from Claude Code via git — never tell Steven to use `/push_code` in Telegram.** Scout's `/push_code` dumps entire file contents into Telegram (4,096-char limit) causing truncation and confusion. Always `git add`, `git commit`, `git push` directly from the Claude Code terminal. This is a hard rule established Session 19.

**Read before write.** Before touching any file that calls an existing module, read that module first. Every crash in this project has been caused by hallucinated method names. Module APIs are documented in `agent/CLAUDE.md` and `tools/CLAUDE.md`.

**Always produce complete replacement files.** Never give partial snippets or "find line X and replace." Steven uploads full files via GitHub web interface.

**Lazy imports for Phase 4+ modules.** `github_pusher`, `sequence_builder`, `fireflies`, `call_processor` are imported INSIDE `execute_tool()`, never at the top of `main.py`.

**Top-level imports for flat tool modules.** `activity_tracker`, `csv_importer`, `daily_call_list`, `district_prospector`, `pipeline_tracker`, `lead_importer` are imported at the top of main.py like sheets_writer.

**tool_result always follows tool_use.** Wrap every `execute_tool()` call in try/except. A result must always be appended to conversation history, even on error. Missing tool_result → 400 on next API call.

**Never use `requests` or `time.sleep()` inside async functions.** Use `httpx.AsyncClient` for HTTP and `await asyncio.sleep()` for delays. Both synchronous versions freeze the asyncio event loop.

**Synchronous code called from async context must use `run_in_executor`.** Wrap blocking I/O in `await loop.run_in_executor(None, fn, args...)`. Never call blocking functions directly from async methods.

**`handle_message()` and async tasks must call `get_gas_bridge()` locally — never reference `gas` as a free variable.** `handle_message()` assigns `gas = get_gas_bridge()` later in the function (line ~1687 for `/call_list`). Python treats `gas` as local throughout the entire function — so any earlier reference raises `UnboundLocalError`. Same applies to `_run_*_scan()` functions spawned via `asyncio.create_task()` from the scheduler — they don't inherit the outer `gas` local. ALWAYS call `get_gas_bridge()` into a local variable like `draft_gas` or `scan_gas` at the top of any new branch or scheduled function. Two latent bugs from this pattern shipped in Session 49.

**New scanners ship with kill switches.** Add an `ENABLE_X_SCAN = True` constant near the top of `tools/signal_processor.py` (next to `SERPER_API_KEY`). Scanner checks the flag at function entry and returns empty if disabled. One-line commit to disable in production without removing code. Examples: `ENABLE_FUNDING_SCAN`, `ENABLE_COMPETITOR_SCAN`.

**Multi-feature sessions ship one commit per feature.** Don't bundle features into one big commit at session end. Separate commits enable surgical `git revert` if a feature causes production issues. Session 49 shipped F3 → F1 → F4 → F2 as separate commits + small fix commits.

**Signal vs. Prospect routing for new lead-gen scanners.** HIGH confidence → auto-queue via `district_prospector.add_district()` as `pending`. MEDIUM/LOW → Signals tab only via `write_signals()`. Active customer match → `customer_intel` log only (don't sell, don't discard). Pattern established in F4 + F2 scanners (Session 49). All queue writes are `pending` — Steven manually approves via `/prospect_approve`. No auto-elevation logic.

**GAS `createDraft` always passes `skip_if_draft_exists=True`.** This prevents duplicate drafts on threads that already have one. GAS-side check via `threadHasDraft(threadId)` iterates `GmailApp.getDrafts()`. Returns `{success: false, already_drafted: true}` which `gas_bridge._call()` passes through (does NOT raise). Email drafter treats `already_drafted` as a soft-skip, not an error.

**`_calculate_priority()` strategies as of Session 49:** `upward` (600-999), `winback` (550-749), `proximity` (400-699), `esa_cluster` (450-599), `intra_district` (750-849), `cs_funding_recipient` (800-899), `competitor_displacement` (650-749), and falls through to `cold` (300-799 by enrollment) for anything unknown. Add new branches for new strategies — falling through to cold gives wrong sort order for warm leads.

**Explicit slash commands bypass Claude and call execute_tool() directly.** `/brief`, `/call`, `/recent_calls`, `/progress`, `/sync_activities`, `/call_list`, `/pipeline`, `/pipeline_import`, `/import_closed_lost`, `/import_leads`, `/import_contacts`, `/enrich_leads`, and all `/prospect_*` commands call execute_tool() directly and return. Direct dispatch is the only reliable pattern — when conversation history is long, Claude responds with descriptive text instead of calling tools.

**`/build_sequence` is a hybrid.** Routes through Claude for clarifying questions. But `execute_tool("build_sequence")` sends output via `await send_message()` directly and returns a short ack string to prevent Claude from rewriting.

**`execute_tool` can send directly to Telegram for long outputs.** For tools that return content Claude tends to rewrite, use `await send_message(full_output)` inside `execute_tool` and return a short ack string.

**Suppress `text_response` when tool_calls are present.** Use `if text_response and not tool_calls:` before sending Claude's text. Tool preamble text is noise.

**Never design workflows that require pasting large text through Telegram.** 4,096 char limit. Use fetch-first: Scout reads from GitHub, asks for changes in plain English.

**GAS bridge: new Code.gs edits need a new deployment version.** See `gas/CLAUDE.md` for the full checklist.

**GAS deployment URL does NOT change when bumping version.** Only need to update Railway env var if creating a brand-new deployment (not editing an existing one).

**Active Accounts "Display Name" column is the account name.** Sheet header currently says "Display Name". Steven wants it renamed to "Active Account Name" — this will happen automatically on next account CSV import (csv_importer rewrites header). Until then, any code reading active accounts must check BOTH column names: `acc.get("Active Account Name", "") or acc.get("Display Name", "")`. The `territory_data.py` gap analysis already has this fallback.

**Urban Institute Education Data API returns county_code as strings, not integers.** `"6037"` not `6037`. All county code comparisons must use string keys.

**Territory gap coverage: school accounts ≠ district coverage.** Only district-level Active Account deals count as "covered." A school account inside a district is an "upward opportunity," not coverage. Coverage % = district deals / total NCES districts.

**Salesforce CSV: Parent Account = always the district.** Account Name can be district/school/library/company. Parent Account filled → sub-unit under that district. Empty → standalone or top-level. One level deep: district → schools.

**CSV import default mode is MERGE (non-destructive).** `/import_clear` switches to clear-and-rewrite for next upload only. `/import_replace_state CA` replaces only that state's rows. `/dedup_accounts` uses Name Key + State composite key.

**`get_districts_with_schools()` state key is `"State"` (capital S).** Active Accounts use capital-S. `s.get("state")` returns empty — always use `s.get("State")`.

**CSV importer preserves ALL columns.** Known columns mapped via `_SF_COL_MAP`/`_OPP_COL_MAP`, unknown pass through. Pipeline uses REPLACE ALL (point-in-time snapshot). Always normalize names to sentence case preserving acronyms (ISD, HS, STEM). CSV uploads decode with utf-8-sig.

**Auto-detect CSV routing by headers.** Priority: pipeline > sf_leads > sf_contacts > accounts. Natural language description or caption overrides auto-detect. Slash commands override everything.

**Pipeline uses 3-tier stale alerts.** 🟠 14+ days, 🟡 30+ days, 🔴 45+ days. Empty Last Activity is NOT flagged.

**Active Accounts "Account Type" column: district | school | library | company.** Old boolean "Is District" column is gone. Do not reintroduce TRUE/FALSE logic.

**Sheet dedup uses email as primary key.** Falls back to `first|last` name for no-email contacts. Don't use name+district — Claude varies district_name spelling.

**Research completion always calls `log_research_job`.** Failure to log is silent.

**`classify_account()` checks district patterns BEFORE school keywords.** "Austin Independent School District" must not match "school" first.

**Name ends in "school" (singular) → school. "schools" (plural) → district.** Explicit rule from Steven.

**District/school names: normalize aggressively, ask when ambiguous.** `normalize_name()` handles abbreviation expansion + suffix stripping. Always normalize both sides before comparing across sources.

**call_processor.py must use claude-sonnet-4-6.** claude-opus-4-5 hangs indefinitely. Anthropic client timeout=90.0.

**`agent/target_roles.py` is the authoritative lead targeting filter.** Contains TIER1/TIER2 titles, CTE relevant/exclude keywords, IT infra exclusions, and `is_relevant_role()` function. Used by `contact_extractor.py` post-extraction. Source: Steven's "ROLES and KEYWORDS" doc.

**Research engine has 20 layers in 5 parallel phases.** Phase A (parallel): L1,L2,L3,L5,L16,L20. Phase B: L4 (domain discovery). Phase C (parallel): L6,L11-L14,L17-L19. Phase D: L7,L8. Phase E: L9→L10→L15→L10. New layers: L16 (Exa broad), L17 (Exa domain-scoped), L18 (Firecrawl extract — needs paid plan), L19 (Firecrawl site map — needs paid plan), L20 (Brave Search).

**Firecrawl paid plan deferred (budget).** L18/L19 skip gracefully when FIRECRAWL_API_KEY has no credits. Was the #1 tool discovery — schema-based extraction pulled 10-20 verified contacts per district. Circle back when budget allows.

**Contact extractor max_tokens is 4000 (not 2000).** School directory pages with 15+ contacts were causing JSON truncation. Fixed Session 40.

**`proximity_engine.py` is a flat module imported at top of main.py.** Targeted + state sweep modes. `add nearby` queues from last results. ESA mapping via `esa [state]`. All direct dispatch. `_last_proximity_result` is in-memory only — lost on bot restart.

**`signal_processor.py` is a flat module imported at top of main.py.** 19 signal sources, 31 Telegram commands, all direct-dispatch. Daily 7:45 AM CST. Weekly Monday: leadership + RFP. Monthly 1st Monday: legislation + grants + budget. On-demand: algebra, cyber, roles, CSTA. BoardDocs/Ballotpedia/RSS wrapped in try/except (non-fatal). `_last_signal_batch` is in-memory — run `/signals` before `/signal_act` or `/signal_info`.

**Signal enrichment must run before acting on signals.** Never queue a district based on a headline alone. `enrich_signal()` does Serper web search + Claude Haiku analysis for CodeCombat relevance (strong/moderate/weak/none). A $6.2B bond can be WEAK if it's all devices. A no-dollar STEAM coordinator hire can be STRONG. Auto-runs on Tier 1 during daily scans; manual via `/signal_enrich N`.

**Google Alerts are weekly digests with all keywords bundled into one email.** Format: `=== News - N new results for [KEYWORD] ===` sections. Parser normalizes `\r\n` to `\n`. `body_limit=65000` required (digests are ~56K chars). ~80 stories per digest.

**`/signals` defaults to territory-only.** `format_hot_signals(territory_only=True)` filters to 13 states + SoCal. Pass state_filter for single-state view. `_last_signal_batch` is also territory-filtered.

**Bond/leadership/RFP signals use urgency="time_sensitive" with minimal decay.** Standard Tier 1 decay is 0.93/week. Time-sensitive signals use 0.97/week because the opportunity window matters more than email age.

**Validate email before calling gas.create_draft().** GAS throws on malformed emails.

**`/call_list` must be guarded in the `/call` handler.** `startswith("/call")` matches both. Use `startswith("/call") and not startswith("/call_list")`.

**Call list per-district cap (_MAX_PER_DISTRICT = 2) applies to BOTH priority matches AND backfill.**

**NEVER fabricate claims about active accounts in sequences.** Only cite verifiable facts: school name, license count. No assumed success/engagement.

**ALL sequences are drafts — always show for Steven's approval.** Write to Google Doc, share link in Telegram, mark prospect as "draft" status. Never auto-finalize or auto-mark "complete". Steven reviews and either approves or gives feedback on changes. This applies to ALL strategies (upward, cold, winback), not just winback.

**Sequence building rules are in `memory/sequence_building_rules.md`.** Load as context when auto-building sequences.

**`scheduler` is a module-level global in main.py.** It must be instantiated at module scope (alongside `memory` and `conversation_history`), not inside `_run_telegram_and_scheduler()`. If it's local to that function, `handle_message()` can't access it and all message handling silently dies. Fixed Session 23.

**`global` declarations go at the TOP of `handle_message()`, not in elif blocks.** Python SyntaxError if `global` appears after first use of the variable. All globals in one line: `global conversation_history, _pending_draft, _last_prospect_batch, _pending_approve_force, _csv_import_mode, _csv_import_state, _pipeline_import_mode, _pending_csv_intent, _last_proximity_result`.

**`_on_prospect_research_complete` is the auto-pipeline callback.** Standard flow → strategy-aware sequence → Google Doc → mark complete. `sequence_builder` lazy imported.

**`/prospect_approve` checks Active Accounts before queuing.** Warns on existing district customers. `_pending_approve_force` + `_last_prospect_batch` are in-memory only — lost on restart.

**Two prospecting strategies — upward and cold.** Upward = school accounts, no district deal. Cold = no presence. 8 priority tiers (900+ to 300+). Small/medium above large in same tier.

**No Salesforce or Outreach API access.** All data enters Scout via CSV export or Gmail notification parsing. Never design features assuming API access to Salesforce, Outreach, PandaDoc, or Dialpad.

**Outreach handoff pattern for cold sequences.** Scout builds content → Google Doc → Steven copy-pastes into Outreach.io. Do NOT try to replace Outreach with Gmail for cold sequences.

**Fireflies Gmail polling uses startup seeding.** First scan adds all existing emails to set without processing. Only post-startup emails trigger workflows.

**`_ensure_tab()` always overwrites the header row.** Column schema changes must propagate immediately.

**Telegram file upload handler is separate.** `handle_document()` uses `filters.Document.ALL`. Never merge into `handle_message`.

**Railway build cache can serve stale code.** If behavior doesn't match, add a logger.info line and check logs after redeploy. If value doesn't appear, trigger manual redeploy.

**After Railway redeploy, wait for "Scout is online" in Telegram before testing.** 409 Conflict errors during ~30s overlap are normal.

## WHAT SCOUT IS

Scout is Steven's always-on AI sales partner — a force multiplier that learns his voice, territory, customers, and patterns. Handles operational/analytical heavy lifting so Steven focuses on relationships and closing.

Communicates via Telegram (@coco_scout_bot). Runs 24/7 on Railway.app.
- Morning brief: 9:15am CST | EOD report: 4:30pm CST | Hourly check-in: 10am–4pm CST
- Persistent memory via GitHub (never cleared)
- Operator: Steven — steven@codecombat.com — CST timezone

**Architecture:**
```
Telegram → agent/main.py (asyncio poll loop)
                ↓
         claude_brain.py (Claude API + tools)
                ↓
    tools/ + GAS bridge + GitHub memory
```

**GAS bridge:** Scout (Railway) → HTTPS POST + secret token → Google Apps Script Web App → Gmail/Calendar/Slides/Docs. Work Google Workspace blocks third-party OAuth; GAS runs inside Google as Steven.
