# SCOUT — Claude Code Reference
*Last updated: 2026-03-25 — Session 36*

---

## CURRENT STATE — update this after each session

**Session 36: Infrastructure session — built session transcript auto-capture system (`scout` command) and locked in plan view format. No code changes to Scout itself. C4 spot-check still pending from Session 35. All Scout code is deployed and running. No uncommitted code changes (except the new scripts and .gitignore from this session).**

### What was done (Session 36)
- **Session transcript auto-capture:** `scout` shell command wraps `claude` with macOS `script`, auto-cleans terminal output to readable markdown, saves to `docs/sessions/session_N.md`. Fallback auto-commit if end-of-session routine is skipped.
- **Plan view format locked in:** Exact template saved to memory — no tables, emoji markers, ➕ additions nested under parent features, consistent structure across all sessions.
- **New files:** `scripts/scout_session.sh`, `scripts/clean_transcript.py`, `docs/sessions/` directory, `.gitignore`
- **Shell alias:** `scout` added to `~/.zshrc`

### What still needs to be done (Session 37+)
- **C4: Spot-check accuracy** — Steven needs to review Prospecting Queue states + C4 Audit SoCal exclusions for the latest /c4 run (1,452 targets). Then final sign-off.
- **C2: Research engine improvements** (after C4)
- **C5: Proximity + regional service centers** (deferred)
- See `SCOUT_PLAN.md` for full roadmap, parked items, and detailed context

### Other completed features
- **Weekend scheduler (B1):** Sat 11am, Sun 1pm greeting. No auto check-ins. `/eod` works manually.
- **Lead row coloring (A3):** Auto-colors by confidence after research. `/color_leads` for manual recolor.

### SF Leads & Contacts import (B2, Sessions 24-28) — VERIFIED
- Tabs: SF Leads, SF Contacts (separate from research Leads). Separate sheet: `GOOGLE_SHEETS_SF_ID` env var.
- `/import_leads`, `/import_contacts`, `/enrich_leads`, `/clear_leads`, `/clear_contacts`
- Cross-checks against Active Accounts (email domain, name, district). Math filter tabs for math-related titles.
- Mutually exclusive routing: math+active → math active, math only → math, active only → assoc active, neither → main.
- `lead_importer` is a flat module imported at top of main.py (NOT lazy). Chunked at 2,000 rows.
- Cross-check rules: school-level active accounts only block SAME school. District-level blocks whole district.
- `clear_tab()` uses `values().clear()` + `updateSheetProperties` grid resize (NOT `deleteDimension`).
- "Leads from Research" = renamed research Leads tab. `TAB_LEADS` constant.

### C1 Territory Master List (Sessions 31-32) — VERIFIED
- NCES CCD 2023 data via Urban Institute API. 13 states + CA (SoCal counties only). 8,133 districts, 40,317 schools.
- Separate sheet: `GOOGLE_SHEETS_TERRITORY_ID`. Tabs: Territory Districts, Territory Schools.
- `/territory_sync`, `/territory_stats`, `/territory_gaps`. Cached in `/tmp/` with 7-day TTL.
- **API returns county_code as strings** (e.g., `"6037"`), not integers.
- Gap coverage: only district-level deals = "covered". School account = "upward opportunity".

### C3 Closed-Lost Winback (Session 33) — VERIFIED
- Separate "Closed Lost" tab (NOT Pipeline). `/import_closed_lost`, `/prospect_winback`.
- Date window: `buffer_months=6` + `lookback_months=18`. Strategy: "winback", Source: "pipeline_closed".
- **Why deals close lost:** 61% Unresponsive, 19% Budget, 5% Not using, 4% Turnover, 2% Competitor.
- All sequences are DRAFTS → Google Doc → Steven reviews. Status includes "draft".

### SoCal CSV Filtering (Sessions 25-27) — COMPLETE
- Offline scripts in `scripts/socal_filter*.py` (5 passes). NOT Scout feature code.
- Merged output: `~/Downloads/My merged leads list - Including SoCal - as of 3-7-26.csv` (86,993 leads), contacts (19,775)
- SoCal counties: Los Angeles, San Diego, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, Kern, Ventura, Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo, Imperial

### Outreach.io API (Session 34)
- Steven's user ID: **11**. Read-only. **NEVER write to Outreach.**
- Tokens persist via GitHub (`memory/outreach_tokens.json`). Railway env vars: `OUTREACH_CLIENT_ID`, `OUTREACH_CLIENT_SECRET`, `OUTREACH_REDIRECT_URI`.

### C4 Cold License Requests (Sessions 34-35)
- Strategy: "cold_license_request" — inbound license requests that went cold (no opp, no pricing sent).
- 3 sequences: IDs 507, 1768, 1860. `/c4`, `/c4_clear`, `/cleanup_queue`, `/fix_queue`.
- **Email domain ranks higher than company name** (`email_priority=True`). Student emails excluded.
- territory_matcher.py: 5-tier matching + Claude inference + comprehensive state extraction.
- `extract_state_from_email()`: k12 domains, .gov, state suffixes, state names, city names.
- `is_socal_domain()`: known SoCal district abbreviations (KNOWN_SOCAL_DOMAIN_ROOTS).
- `is_student_email()`: "student" anywhere in domain.
- C4 Audit tab for spot-checking exclusions.

---

### Session transcript capture
- Steven starts sessions with `scout` in terminal (not `claude`). This wraps Claude Code with `script` to capture full transcripts.
- Transcripts save to `docs/sessions/session_N.md`. Raw captures in `docs/sessions/.raw/` (gitignored).
- During end-of-session routine: run `python3 scripts/clean_transcript.py "$SCOUT_RAW_TRANSCRIPT" "$SCOUT_CLEAN_TRANSCRIPT"`, then include the clean file in the commit.
- Env vars available: `SCOUT_SESSION_NUM`, `SCOUT_RAW_TRANSCRIPT`, `SCOUT_CLEAN_TRANSCRIPT`.
- Steven uses `/exit` between sessions (not `/clear`) so each `scout` run = one transcript file.
- Wrapper script auto-commits as fallback if end-of-session routine is skipped.

---

## CRITICAL RULES

**Always push code changes from Claude Code via git — never tell Steven to use `/push_code` in Telegram.** Scout's `/push_code` dumps entire file contents into Telegram (4,096-char limit) causing truncation and confusion. Always `git add`, `git commit`, `git push` directly from the Claude Code terminal. This is a hard rule established Session 19.

**Read before write.** Before touching any file that calls an existing module, read that module first. Every crash in this project has been caused by hallucinated method names. Module APIs are documented in `agent/CLAUDE.md` and `tools/CLAUDE.md`.

**Always produce complete replacement files.** Never give partial snippets or "find line X and replace." Steven uploads full files via GitHub web interface.

**Lazy imports for Phase 4+ modules.** `github_pusher`, `sequence_builder`, `fireflies`, `call_processor` are imported INSIDE `execute_tool()`, never at the top of `main.py`.

**Top-level imports for flat tool modules.** `activity_tracker`, `csv_importer`, `daily_call_list`, `district_prospector`, `pipeline_tracker`, `lead_importer` are imported at the top of main.py like sheets_writer.

**tool_result always follows tool_use.** Wrap every `execute_tool()` call in try/except. A result must always be appended to conversation history, even on error. Missing tool_result → 400 on next API call.

**Never use `requests` or `time.sleep()` inside async functions.** Use `httpx.AsyncClient` for HTTP and `await asyncio.sleep()` for delays. Both synchronous versions freeze the asyncio event loop.

**Synchronous code called from async context must use `run_in_executor`.** Wrap blocking I/O in `await loop.run_in_executor(None, fn, args...)`. Never call blocking functions directly from async methods.

**Explicit slash commands bypass Claude and call execute_tool() directly.** `/brief`, `/call`, `/recent_calls`, `/progress`, `/sync_activities`, `/call_list`, `/pipeline`, `/pipeline_import`, `/import_closed_lost`, `/import_leads`, `/import_contacts`, `/enrich_leads`, and all `/prospect_*` commands call execute_tool() directly and return. Direct dispatch is the only reliable pattern — when conversation history is long, Claude responds with descriptive text instead of calling tools.

**`/build_sequence` is a hybrid.** Routes through Claude for clarifying questions. But `execute_tool("build_sequence")` sends output via `await send_message()` directly and returns a short ack string to prevent Claude from rewriting.

**`execute_tool` can send directly to Telegram for long outputs.** For tools that return content Claude tends to rewrite, use `await send_message(full_output)` inside `execute_tool` and return a short ack string.

**Suppress `text_response` when tool_calls are present.** Use `if text_response and not tool_calls:` before sending Claude's text. Tool preamble text is noise.

**Never design workflows that require pasting large text through Telegram.** 4,096 char limit. Use fetch-first: Scout reads from GitHub, asks for changes in plain English.

**GAS bridge: new Code.gs edits need a new deployment version.** See `gas/CLAUDE.md` for the full checklist.

**GAS deployment URL does NOT change when bumping version.** Only need to update Railway env var if creating a brand-new deployment (not editing an existing one).

**Active Accounts "Display Name" column is the account name.** Sheet header currently says "Display Name". Steven wants it renamed to "Active Account Name" — this will happen automatically on next account CSV import (csv_importer rewrites header). Until then, any code reading active accounts must check BOTH column names: `acc.get("Active Account Name", "") or acc.get("Display Name", "")`. The `territory_data.py` gap analysis already has this fallback.

**Urban Institute Education Data API returns county_code as strings, not integers.** `"6037"` not `6037`. All county code comparisons must use string keys.

**Territory gap coverage: school accounts ≠ district coverage.** Only district-level Active Account deals count as "covered." A school account inside a district is an "upward opportunity," not coverage. Coverage % = district deals / total NCES districts.

**Salesforce CSV: Parent Account = always the district.** Account Name can be district/school/library/company. Parent Account filled → sub-unit under that district. Empty → standalone or top-level. One level deep: district → schools.

**CSV import default mode is MERGE (non-destructive).** Matches by Name Key: updates existing rows, appends new ones, leaves unmatched rows untouched. `/import_clear` switches to clear-and-rewrite mode for the next upload only — but still respects auto-detect routing (accounts vs pipeline). `/import_merge` switches back explicitly. `/import_replace_state CA` replaces only rows matching that state — all other states untouched (always routes to Active Accounts).

**`/dedup_accounts` uses Name Key + State as composite key (fixed Session 18).** Safe to use — will not merge same-named schools from different states.

**`merge_accounts()` auto-deduplicates existing rows before merging.** If multiple rows share the same Name Key, keeps only the last one. Prevents duplicate buildup from repeated uploads (fixed Session 21).

**`cleanup_and_format_sheets()` runs on startup.** Deletes unused tabs (Sheet1, Salesforce Import), applies alternating row banding (white/light gray-blue) to all tabs. Safe to call repeatedly — skips already-banded tabs.

**`get_districts_with_schools()` state key is `"State"` (capital S).** Active Accounts sheet rows use capital-S key. Using `s.get("state")` returns empty string — always use `s.get("State")`. Fixed Session 19.

**CSV importer preserves ALL columns from the Salesforce export.** Known columns are mapped to internal keys via `_SF_COL_MAP`. Unknown columns pass through with their original CSV header name. The sheet header row extends dynamically.

**Always normalize Salesforce/Outreach names to sentence case.** Account names, opp names, contact names, and parent accounts often come in ALL CAPS. Convert to natural title case ("ARLINGTON ISD" → "Arlington ISD") while preserving known acronyms (ISD, HS, STEM, etc.). Applies to any import, display, or use in sequences/emails.

**CSV uploads decode with utf-8-sig.** Strips BOM from Salesforce/Excel exports.

**Pipeline tab uses REPLACE ALL on import — not merge.** Pipeline is a point-in-time snapshot. Every opp CSV upload clears and rewrites the entire Pipeline tab.

**Pipeline importer preserves ALL CSV columns.** Known columns mapped via `_OPP_COL_MAP`, unknown columns pass through with original header name. Same dynamic header pattern as csv_importer.

**Auto-detect CSV routing by headers.** Priority: pipeline > sf_leads > sf_contacts > accounts. Pipeline: 2+ of {Stage, Close Date, Opportunity Name} without account-only columns. SF Leads: 2+ of {Lead Source, Lead Status, Company} without account-only columns. SF Contacts: 2+ of {Account Name, Department, Contact Owner} + name columns without account-only columns. Everything else → Active Accounts. `/import_replace_state` overrides auto-detect and forces account import. `/import_clear` sets clear mode but still respects auto-detect routing. `/import_leads` and `/import_contacts` force SF Leads/Contacts routing.

**Natural language CSV description overrides auto-detect.** Steven can describe what a CSV is before uploading (or as a caption on the file). `_parse_csv_intent()` detects keywords: pipeline/opportunity → Pipeline tab; lead/salesforce lead → SF Leads tab; contact/salesforce contact → SF Contacts tab; account/customer → Active Accounts; prospect → Active Accounts. Priority: slash commands > caption > pre-message description > auto-detect.

**Pipeline uses 3-tier stale alerts.** 🟠 Needs Update (14+ days), 🟡 Needs Check-In / Going Stale (30+ days), 🔴 Risk Going Cold! (45+ days). Past-due Close Date also triggers. Empty Last Activity is NOT flagged (no data ≠ stale). Thresholds are constants in pipeline_tracker.py (TIER_NEEDS_UPDATE, TIER_GOING_STALE, TIER_GOING_COLD).

**Active Accounts "Account Type" column: district | school | library | company.** Old boolean "Is District" column is gone. Do not reintroduce TRUE/FALSE logic.

**Sheet dedup uses email as primary key.** Falls back to `first|last` name for no-email contacts. Don't use name+district — Claude varies district_name spelling.

**Research completion always calls `log_research_job`.** Failure to log is silent.

**`classify_account()` checks district patterns BEFORE school keywords.** "Austin Independent School District" must not match "school" first.

**Name ends in "school" (singular) → school. "schools" (plural) → district.** Explicit rule from Steven.

**District/school names: normalize aggressively, ask when ambiguous.** `normalize_name()` handles abbreviation expansion + suffix stripping. Always normalize both sides before comparing across sources.

**call_processor.py must use claude-sonnet-4-6.** claude-opus-4-5 hangs indefinitely. Anthropic client timeout=90.0.

**Validate email before calling gas.create_draft().** GAS throws on malformed emails.

**`/call_list` must be guarded in the `/call` handler.** `startswith("/call")` matches both. Use `startswith("/call") and not startswith("/call_list")`.

**Call list per-district cap (_MAX_PER_DISTRICT = 2) applies to BOTH priority matches AND backfill.**

**NEVER fabricate claims about active accounts in sequences.** Only cite verifiable facts: school name, license count. No assumed success/engagement.

**ALL sequences are drafts — always show for Steven's approval.** Write to Google Doc, share link in Telegram, mark prospect as "draft" status. Never auto-finalize or auto-mark "complete". Steven reviews and either approves or gives feedback on changes. This applies to ALL strategies (upward, cold, winback), not just winback.

**Sequence building rules are in `memory/sequence_building_rules.md`.** Load as context when auto-building sequences.

**`scheduler` is a module-level global in main.py.** It must be instantiated at module scope (alongside `memory` and `conversation_history`), not inside `_run_telegram_and_scheduler()`. If it's local to that function, `handle_message()` can't access it and all message handling silently dies. Fixed Session 23.

**`global` declarations go at the TOP of `handle_message()`, not in elif blocks.** Python SyntaxError if `global` appears after first use of the variable. All globals in one line: `global conversation_history, _pending_draft, _last_prospect_batch, _pending_approve_force, _csv_import_mode, _csv_import_state, _pipeline_import_mode, _pending_csv_intent`.

**`_on_prospect_research_complete` is the auto-pipeline callback.** Runs `_on_research_complete` first (standard flow), then auto-builds a strategy-aware sequence, writes Google Doc, marks prospect complete. Uses `sequence_builder` (lazy import inside the callback). If sequence fails, prospect is still marked complete.

**`sequence_builder.build_sequence()` uses max_tokens=6000 and retries once on JSON parse failure.** First attempt uses A/B variants. If JSON parse fails, retries with `ab_variants=False` (simpler, smaller response). Large districts (LAUSD etc.) can produce malformed JSON on first attempt due to long email bodies.

**`/prospect_approve` checks Active Accounts before queuing research.** If any approved district is already an active customer (Account Type == "district"), Scout warns and asks yes/no. `_pending_approve_force` global holds flagged districts awaiting confirmation. Replying "yes"/"confirm"/"proceed" queues them anyway; "no"/"skip"/"cancel" clears them. Clean districts (not active customers) are queued immediately without interruption.

**`_last_prospect_batch` is in-memory only — lost on bot restart.** Always run `/prospect` before `/prospect_approve` or `/prospect_skip` in a new session or after any Railway redeploy. The batch is not persisted to disk or Sheets.

**Two prospecting strategies — upward and cold.** Upward = districts with active school accounts, no district deal. Cold = no CodeCombat presence. Strategy column tracks this. Sequences differ by strategy.

**Prospecting priority tiers (8 levels).** Tier 1 (900+): upward 3+ schools. Tier 2 (800+): upward highest licenses. Tier 3 (700+): cold small/medium. Tier 4 (600+): upward 1 school large district. Tiers 5-7: deferred. Tier 8 (300+): cold large. Small/medium always above large in same tier.

**No Salesforce or Outreach API access.** All data enters Scout via CSV export or Gmail notification parsing. Never design features assuming API access to Salesforce, Outreach, PandaDoc, or Dialpad.

**Outreach handoff pattern for cold sequences.** Scout builds content → Google Doc → Steven copy-pastes into Outreach.io. Do NOT try to replace Outreach with Gmail for cold sequences.

**Fireflies Gmail polling uses startup seeding.** First scan adds all existing emails to set without processing. Only post-startup emails trigger workflows.

**`_ensure_tab()` always overwrites the header row.** Column schema changes must propagate immediately.

**Telegram file upload handler is separate.** `handle_document()` uses `filters.Document.ALL`. Never merge into `handle_message`.

**Railway build cache can serve stale code.** If behavior doesn't match, add a logger.info line and check logs after redeploy. If value doesn't appear, trigger manual redeploy.

**After Railway redeploy, wait for "Scout is online" in Telegram before testing.** 409 Conflict errors during ~30s overlap are normal.

## WHAT SCOUT IS

Scout is Steven's always-on AI sales partner — a force multiplier that learns his voice, territory, customers, and patterns. Handles operational/analytical heavy lifting so Steven focuses on relationships and closing.

Communicates via Telegram (@coco_scout_bot). Runs 24/7 on Railway.app.
- Morning brief: 9:15am CST | EOD report: 4:30pm CST | Hourly check-in: 10am–4pm CST
- Persistent memory via GitHub (never cleared)
- Operator: Steven — steven@codecombat.com — CST timezone

**Architecture:**
```
Telegram → agent/main.py (asyncio poll loop)
                ↓
         claude_brain.py (Claude API + tools)
                ↓
    tools/ + GAS bridge + GitHub memory
```

**GAS bridge:** Scout (Railway) → HTTPS POST + secret token → Google Apps Script Web App → Gmail/Calendar/Slides/Docs. Work Google Workspace blocks third-party OAuth; GAS runs inside Google as Steven.
