# Handoff — S69 EOS (2026-04-15 09:17 CDT, ctx 42% measured)

## 🎯 S70 KICKOFF — walk Steven through the GAS redeploy for CRIT-2

**First action on S70 startup: walk Steven through deploying the updated `gas/Code.gs` to script.google.com.**

The placeholder-token guard (commit `65976b9`) is code-complete but sitting in git — it does NOT protect production until Steven redeploys the web app. Per `gas/CLAUDE.md §Deployment Checklist`:

1. Open https://script.google.com → find "Scout Bridge" project → open `Code.gs`
2. Paste the new `doPost` entry — specifically the 4-line block at the top of the `try` that checks `SECRET_TOKEN === "REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_SECRET_TOKEN_HERE" || !SECRET_TOKEN`. Either paste the whole updated file or hand-edit just `doPost`.
3. Click **Save** (Cmd+S).
4. Click **Deploy → Manage deployments** → pencil icon on the active deployment → **Version: New version** → **Deploy**.
5. **URL stays the same on new version** — no Railway env update needed (per gas/CLAUDE.md gotcha).
6. From Telegram: send `/ping_gas` and confirm "GAS bridge OK" response. If it returns the new 500 `"Server misconfigured: SECRET_TOKEN not set"` error, then `SECRET_TOKEN` in the deployed Code.gs is still the placeholder — Steven needs to substitute the real token on line 22 before redeploying.

**Why Steven should care:** until redeploy, the fix is a no-op in production. A future fresh deploy that forgot to set `SECRET_TOKEN` would still silently accept any caller sending `"REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_SECRET_TOKEN_HERE"`. This is the security guard — it's worth 30 seconds of deploy friction.

# Handoff — S69 pause at 41% ctx measured (2026-04-15 09:13 CDT)

## Where we are
- **Overnight audit run complete** — report at `SCOUT_AUDIT_2026-04-15_0128.md` (270 verified findings; 2 CRIT, 72 HIGH, 117 MED, 75 LOW, 4 NIT).
- **Both CRITICALs fixed** in this session, ready to commit. Nothing else from the Top 10 touched.

## What was fixed (2 CRITICALs, atomic)

### CRIT-1 — `agent/main.py:1775` — `gas` NameError in `/unanswered`
Added `gas = get_gas_bridge()` + None-guard immediately after the "Checking for unanswered..." status send. Mirrors the pattern every other `gas`-dependent branch uses. No more `NameError: name 'gas' is not defined` when `/unanswered` fires.

### CRIT-2 — `gas/Code.gs:30` (doPost entry) — placeholder token guard
Added a runtime check at the top of `doPost` that returns HTTP-500 `"Server misconfigured: SECRET_TOKEN not set"` if `SECRET_TOKEN === "REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_SECRET_TOKEN_HERE"` or empty. Prevents a new deploy from silently accepting any caller who sends the placeholder string.

**⚠ Deployment gotcha (per `gas/CLAUDE.md`):** gas/Code.gs changes require manual redeploy. Steven needs to: (1) paste Code.gs into script.google.com, (2) Deploy → Manage deployments → New version, (3) URL stays the same, so no Railway update needed. Just verify via `/ping_gas` after.

## Top 10 action list — 8 items still pending

In priority order from the report's "Top 10 Actions":

3. **HIGH-4 (fix-now)** — `agent/main.py:3567` — dedupe `/scan_compliance` elif branches. Lines 3567 and 3689 both match `/scan_compliance`; line 3567 wins, line 3689 is dead. Different arg counts → wrong code path runs.
4. **HIGH-3 (fix-now)** — `agent/main.py:3015` — wrap `format_hot_signals` in `run_in_executor` and pass the pre-filtered `sigs` list. Current `/signals new` blocks event loop AND ignores its own filter.
5. **HIGH-5 (fix-now)** — `gas/Code.gs:189` — `createDraftReply` passes `""` as body positional arg; real body goes to unrecognized `options.body` key. Plain-text reply drafts ship blank. (Would bundle with CRIT-2 redeploy.)
6. **HIGH-9 (fix-now)** — 3 divergent `classify_role` in `scripts/audit_c4_prospects.py:74`, `scripts/enrich_c4_pass2.py:336`, `scripts/enrich_c4_titles.py:301`. Rename to `_classify_role_c4` to avoid collision with `tools/role_classifier`, or delete and use tools version.
7. **HIGH-13 (fix-now)** — `scripts/bug5_phase0_scan.py:39/71/93/94/95` — `-1` sentinel index bug. `dn_idx < len(row)` passes when `dn_idx=-1`, so `row[-1]` is silently returned. Add `dn_idx != -1 and` to guards.
8. **HIGH-11 (investigate)** — `scripts/bug5_cleanup_lackland_test.py:40` — off-by-one in deleteDimension. **Before re-running, check the sheet for rows deleted one below the intended target** — the bug may already have corrupted the sheet in prior runs.
9. **HIGH-8 (fix-now)** — `scripts/ab_research_engine.py:324` — cost ceiling compares only v1 cost but docstring says "combined v1+v2". Allows ~2× overspend.
10. **HIGH-2 (fix-now)** — `agent/main.py:1307` — `cross_checked` counter extracted from SF Contacts import result but dropped from summary. Silent data-integrity gap.

## Themes (higher leverage than any single fix)

From the report's `## Themes` section — each collapses many findings into one fix:
- `asyncio.get_event_loop()` → `asyncio.get_running_loop()` (deprecated in 3.10+, ~30 call sites in main.py + 5 in research_engine.py).
- Serper HTTP status not checked before `resp.json()` in `compliance_gap_scanner`, `private_schools`, `fetch_csta_roster`, `f4_serper_replay`, `enrich_c4_pass2` (failed API calls silently produce empty results).
- `scripts/*.py` all crash on missing `.env` / missing env vars with raw KeyError / FileNotFoundError (no helpful message).
- `chr(65+col)` column-letter arithmetic in `enrich_c4_pass2`, `phase1_ground_truth_lackland`, `phase2b_sample_fingerprints` — silently wraps past column Z.
- Broad `except Exception: pass` swallowing data-integrity counters.
- One-shot scripts hardcoding timestamps (`"2026-04-"`, `DRIP_DAYS`) that will silently no-op after their window.

## Next-step

Per the 40% pause protocol, stopped at clean boundary (2 CRITICALs done, atomic). Waiting for Steven's direction on:
- (a) full wrap-up (EOS) now, or
- (b) Steven sends his EOS prompt, or
- (c) continue one specific named HIGH item (suggest HIGH-4 or HIGH-3 next — both single-file edits in main.py).

## Files changed this session

- `agent/main.py` — CRIT-1 fix
- `gas/Code.gs` — CRIT-2 fix (requires manual GAS redeploy before it takes effect)
- `.claude/handoff.md` — this file
