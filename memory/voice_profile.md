# Steven's Email Voice Profile

## Tone & Personality
Steven comes across as **helpful, casual, and direct** — like a friendly colleague rather than a polished corporate salesperson. He's warm without being saccharine, efficient without being cold. There's a genuine "I'm here to help you get this done" energy throughout his emails. He's comfortable being informal (using tildes, emojis, casual phrases) but can shift to more professional tones when dealing with procurement or administrative contacts. He doesn't take himself too seriously — acknowledging his own mistakes ("Sorry I missed this email") and being self-deprecating about the sales process ("No pushy salespeople here! 😉"). He's patient with educators who are navigating bureaucracy and budget constraints, often expressing genuine empathy ("I know that must be disappointing 😞").

## Tone Matching in Replies
Steven **mirrors the sender's energy** closely:
- **Ultra-brief incoming → Ultra-brief reply**: "Yes and we have tons of usage in LAUSD" (responding to a one-line question)
- **Casual/apologetic incoming → Warm and reassuring**: "No worries Anson~ I actually got pulled away myself."
- **Formal/bureaucratic incoming → More structured but still accessible**: When responding to procurement analysts, he provides thorough information but maintains his accessible voice
- **Frustrated or disappointed incoming → Empathetic + solution-oriented**: "Ah, so sorry to hear it, Chad, I know that must be disappointing. 😞" followed by actionable resources

He leads with warmth but doesn't overcorrect — if someone is brief, he stays brief. He doesn't force formality where it doesn't exist.

## Sentence Structure
Steven uses a **mix of short punchy sentences and medium-length explanatory ones**. He favors:
- **Short confirmations**: "Yes, It all comes together" / "Got it." / "Sounds good!" / "Sent"
- **Direct statements**: "I will shoot you all the info shortly"
- **Conversational fragments**: "Sorry, not sure what you're referring to."
- **Lists over paragraphs** when conveying multiple points

His pacing feels conversational — like talking, not writing. He doesn't over-explain or pad sentences. When he needs to provide detailed information (pricing, features), he uses bullet points and tables rather than dense paragraphs.

## Opening Style
**Replies typically open with:**
- Name + casual greeting: "Hey Kent," / "Hi Elaine," / "Hi Louise,"
- Acknowledgment or response to their message: "Thanks for letting me know, David." / "Got it." / "That sounds great."
- Casual variations: "Hey Daphne," / "Hi all,"

**Cold/outbound emails open with:**
- Name alone on a line: "Joyce," / "Armando," / "Destiny,"
- Or a soft re-engagement: "Checking back with you" / "I wanted to check if you've been able to connect..."
- Context-setting: "I wanted to provide a summarized, clear overview of our licensing options"

He almost never uses "I hope this email finds you well" or other filler openers.

## Closing / CTA Style
Steven's CTAs are **soft but clear** — he offers options rather than demands:
- "Let me know if you think giving the teachers some free licenses to try it out would be helpful later."
- "Let me know what makes sense. I'm here to help however I can."
- "Want to set up a time to connect and go over the options and pricing?"
- "Pick any day or time that works for you here [link]"
- "Let me know if you still need help!"
- "Feel free to call me at 415 854 9198"

He frequently provides scheduling links as a low-friction next step. His CTAs are invitations, not pressure.

## Sign-off
Steven uses varied sign-offs depending on context:
- **Most common**: No sign-off at all (just ends the email)
- **Semi-formal**: "Best," / "Best, Steven"
- **Casual**: "-Steven" / "All the best!"
- **Abbreviated**: Just his signature block

His email signature includes:
```
STEVEN ADKINS | O: 415.854.9198
CodeCombat x Ozaria Senior Partnership Manager
2261 Market Street #4388 San Francisco, CA 94114 | United States
"To bring up a child in the way he should go, travel that way yourself once in a while." - Josh Billings
```

## Punctuation & Formatting Habits
- **Heavy use of bullet points**: For pricing, features, free content lists, grant resources
- **Bold text** for emphasis: "*free content*", "*pre-made templates*", "*hand-picked*"
- **Emojis**: Used sparingly but consistently — 😞 (empathy), 👉 (pointing to resources), 💸 (grants), 👇 (lists below), 😉 (lightening tone)
- **Tilde (~)** for casual warmth: "No worries Anson~"
- **Tables** for pricing information
- **Links formatted with descriptive text**: "Select a time here" / "digital quote for [School Name]"
- **Minimal exclamation points** — uses them naturally, not excessively
- **Em dashes** occasionally for asides
- **No ellipses** in professional context

## Subject Line Style
Steven typically:
- **Keeps original subject lines** in reply threads (standard Re: format)
- Uses descriptive, action-oriented subjects for cold emails:
  - "CodeCombat Licensing and Pricing Guide"
  - "Your CodeCombat License Request!"
  - "Spring semester question"
  - "Limited Pilot run of Ozaria and CodeCombat"
  - "Free PD Account for your teachers (CodeCombat)"
  - "Tried reaching you!"

His cold subject lines are clear about the content — no clickbait, no gimmicks.

## What He Avoids
- **No corporate jargon**: No "synergy," "leverage," "circle back," "touch base"
- **No walls of text**: Even detailed emails are broken up with bullets/whitespace
- **No excessive formality**: No "Dear Mr./Ms." or stiff language
- **No pressure tactics**: No "limited time only!" urgency (except when genuinely applicable)
- **No apologies for following up** (though he apologizes for delays)
- **No fluff intros**: Skips "I hope this finds you well"
- **No passive-aggressive tones** when dealing with bureaucracy or delays
- **No over-promising**: Realistic about what he can do

## Key Phrases He Uses
1. **"Let me know if you need anything else"** / "Let me know what makes sense"
2. **"Happy to help"** / "I'm here to help however I can"
3. **"Want to [action]?"** — soft CTA structure
4. **"Sorry for the delay"** / "Sorry I missed this email"
5. **"Here's all the free content we have baked in"**
6. **"I will shoot you all the info shortly"**
7. **"Sounds good"** — simple acknowledgment
8. **"No worries"** / "No problem at all"
9. **"Check these out:"** — introducing resource lists
10. **"Ah, so sorry to hear it, [Name], I know that must be disappointing. 😞"**

## Length & Structure
**Cold emails**: Medium-length, well-structured with:
- Brief personal opener
- Clear value proposition or reason for reaching out
- Bullet-pointed details/features
- Soft CTA with scheduling link

**Reply emails**: Highly variable based on context:
- Can be as short as 3-4 words: "Yes and we have tons of usage in LAUSD"
- Or detailed with tables and bullet points when answering pricing/feature questions
- Matches the complexity of the incoming question

**Formatting patterns**:
- Heavy use of white space
- Section headers in bold when covering multiple topics
- Tables for pricing (not buried in prose)
- Numbered lists for action items or questions

## Cold vs. Reply vs. Follow-up Differences

**Cold emails** are more structured:
- Lead with context/reason for outreach
- Provide comprehensive info upfront
- Include multiple resources/links
- Clear but soft CTA

Example structure:
> "Hey Elaine,
> 
> I thought this option we're running might make sense?
> 
> We are offering discounted spring semester Pilots..."
> [bullet points with details]
> "Happy to..."

**Reply emails** are adaptive:
- Match the sender's length and formality
- Often just a few lines when confirming/acknowledging
- Expand when answering questions

Short reply example:
> "Yes, It all comes together"

Detailed reply example (to a question):
> "Hi Sharon,
> 
> Our minimum purchase order is 10 annual licenses for $70 each ($700).
> 
> *License Features:*
> [detailed bullets and tables]"

**Follow-up emails** are:
- Brief and non-pushy
- Reference previous communication
- Offer new value/angle

Example:
> "Checking back with you -I wanted to see if you heard about this.
> 
> *Through the end of September*, we will be offering a promo..."

**Summary**: Steven writes like a helpful human, not a sales robot. He's efficient, empathetic, and adapts fluidly to each recipient's communication style. His emails prioritize clarity and actionability over polish, and he's comfortable being brief when brevity serves the conversation.
