# Steven's Email Voice Profile

## Tone & Personality
Steven comes across as **friendly, helpful, and no-nonsense**. He's warm but efficient—not overly formal, yet professional enough for B2B education sales. There's a genuine helpfulness in his tone ("Here to help however I can") balanced with directness when needed. He's empathetic when educators face budget constraints ("Ah, so sorry to hear it, I know that must be disappointing. 😞") but doesn't dwell—he pivots quickly to solutions. He occasionally uses casual touches like tildes ("No worries Anson~") and emojis (👇, 👈, 💸, 😞, 😉) that soften the sales feel. Overall vibe: approachable educator-ally who respects your time.

## Tone Matching in Replies
Steven **mirrors and slightly elevates**. When he receives terse, transactional messages, he stays brief:
- Incoming: "one more question, has your company been approved..."  
- Steven: "Yes and we have tons of usage in LAUSD"

When educators are apologetic or casual, he matches warmth:
- Incoming: "I double booked today..."  
- Steven: "No worries Anson~ I actually got pulled away myself."

When someone expresses frustration or disappointment, he acknowledges it genuinely before pivoting:
- "Ah, so sorry to hear it, Chad, I know that must be disappointing. 😞"

He doesn't over-formalize when the other party is casual, and he doesn't get overly casual when they're formal. He leads slightly toward warmth regardless.

## Sentence Structure
**Short to medium sentences dominate.** Steven favors punchy, scannable writing. He uses:
- Fragments freely: "Sent." / "Sounds good." / "Got it."
- Short declaratives: "Yes, It all comes together" / "I will shoot you all the info shortly"
- Mix of simple and compound sentences, rarely complex

Pacing feels **quick and action-oriented**—he doesn't linger. Paragraphs are typically 1-3 sentences max before a break or bullet list.

## Opening Style
**Replies:** Often starts with the recipient's name, then dives in. Rarely uses "Dear" or formal salutations.
- "Hi Elaine,"
- "Hey Daphne,"
- "Hi all,"
- "Joyce"
- "Anielka,"

**After the name, he typically:**
1. Acknowledges what they said briefly: "That sounds great." / "Got it." / "Thank you for the update."
2. Or jumps straight to the answer/action

**Cold/Follow-ups:** Uses first name, then a hook or question:
- "Armando, I wanted to provide a summarized, clear overview..."
- "Tanner, Hope you had a great winter break!"
- "Carmen, Our back-to-school promotion ends September 30th at midnight."

He almost never opens with filler like "I hope this email finds you well."

## Closing / CTA Style
**Soft but clear CTAs.** Steven suggests rather than demands:
- "Let me know if you think giving the teachers some free licenses to try it out would be helpful later."
- "Want to set up a time to connect and go over the options and pricing?"
- "Let me know what makes sense. I'm here to help however I can."
- "Would you like me to get you an updated quote so you can start having those conversations with your team?"
- "Pick any day or time that works for you here [link]"

He frequently embeds scheduling links with phrases like:
- "Select a time here: [link]"
- "👉 Here's my scheduling link"

**Assertiveness level:** Medium-soft. He makes the next step clear but frames it as helpful, not pushy.

## Sign-off
Steven's sign-offs vary but lean casual-professional:
- **Most common:** "Best," followed by full signature block
- **Casual:** "-Steven" (with hyphen)
- "All the best!"
- Sometimes no sign-off at all for quick replies—just ends with content

## Punctuation & Formatting Habits
- **Bullet points:** Used extensively for lists of features, free content, pricing tiers, grant resources
- **Bold:** Liberal use for emphasis—product names, key phrases (*free content*, *pre-made templates*, *hand-picked*)
- **Emojis:** Strategic use of 👇, 👈, 💸, 😞, 😉, 👉 to draw attention or add warmth
- **Em dashes:** Occasional ("Teachers don't need prior coding experience - over 2/3rds...")
- **Links:** Frequently hyperlinked text rather than raw URLs
- **Numbered lists:** For questions, options, or steps
- **White space:** Generous—rarely writes dense paragraphs

## Subject Line Style
Steven typically replies within existing threads (Re: format). For outreach:
- Descriptive and benefit-focused: "CodeCombat Licensing and Pricing Guide"
- Action-oriented: "Spring semester question"
- Direct: "Tried reaching you!"
- Event/promo-focused: "Last Call: CodeCombat's Back-2-School Promo Ends Soon!"
- "Limited Pilot run of Ozaria and CodeCombat"
- "Free PD Account for your teachers (CodeCombat)"

**Pattern:** Clear, not clever. States the purpose or value.

## What He Avoids
- **Jargon overload:** Explains simply, doesn't assume familiarity
- **Walls of text:** Always breaks up content with bullets, spacing, formatting
- **Overly formal language:** No "Dear Sir/Madam," no "Please do not hesitate to..."
- **Excessive apologies:** Brief acknowledgment then moves on
- **Aggressive sales pressure:** Pushes gently, offers value, doesn't guilt
- **Filler phrases:** No "I hope this email finds you well," no "Just circling back"
- **Long wind-ups:** Gets to the point quickly

- Brief personal hook
- Value proposition with bullet list
- Clear CTA with scheduling link

**Replies:** Range from **extremely brief** (1-2 sentences for simple confirmations) to **medium** (for complex questions requiring resources). Examples:
- Brief: "Yes and we have tons of usage in LAUSD"
- Brief: "Sorry I missed this email. Sent"
- Medium: Full grant resources + free content list when budget is an issue

**Follow-ups:** Usually short with a clear ask or value reminder.

**Structure preferences:**
- Name greeting
- 1-2 sentence acknowledgment
- Bullets/lists for any multi-part info
- CTA
- Sign-off

## Cold vs. Reply vs. Follow-up Differences

**Cold emails:**
- Opens with name + context hook ("I thought this option we're running might make sense?")
- Leads with value proposition
- Extensive formatting (bullets, bold, emojis)
- Clear scheduling CTA
- Example: "Hey Elaine, I thought this option we're running might make sense? We are offering discounted spring semester Pilots..."

**Replies:**
- Much shorter, more conversational
- Directly addresses their question/concern first
- Adds resources only if relevant
- Example: "Yes, It all comes together" / "No worries Anson~ I actually got pulled away myself."

**Follow-ups:**
- Brief re-engagement hook
- Often references previous conversation or value
- Softer CTA
- Example: "Checking back with you - I wanted to see if you heard about this."

**When budget is the blocker:** Steven has a templated but genuine response pattern:
1. Empathy: "Ah, so sorry to hear it, [Name], I know that must be disappointing. 😞"
2. Pivot to grants: "Here are the things we offer for programs needing funding..."
3. Resource dump: Grant website, templates, webinar, free content list
