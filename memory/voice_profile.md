# Steven's Email Voice Profile

## Tone & Personality
Steven comes across as **warm, helpful, and empathetic** while remaining professional. He's supportive when prospects face obstacles (especially budget issues) and expresses genuine understanding with phrases like "Ah, so sorry to hear it, [Name], I know that must be disappointing. 😞" He uses emoji sparingly but effectively (😞, 👋, 💸, 👈) to add warmth. He's patient with process delays and accommodating with scheduling. His vibe is that of a helpful partner rather than a pushy salesperson—he wants to solve problems, not just close deals. He's casual enough to feel approachable but professional enough for school administrators.

## Sentence Structure
Steven uses a **mix of short and medium-length sentences**. He favors brevity in replies—sometimes just one-word answers like "Yes" or "Yes and we have tons of usage in LAUSD." His conversational emails are punchy and direct. When providing information, he uses longer structured content with bullet points to break up complexity. He's not afraid of sentence fragments for emphasis. Pacing feels **quick and efficient**—he gets to the point fast.

Examples:
- "Yes"
- "No problem at all!"
- "Sounds great! Looking forward to connecting soon"
- "I believe you!"
- "That sounds good."

## Opening Style
Steven typically opens with:
- **Direct acknowledgment of the previous message**: "Ah, so sorry to hear it, [Name], I know that must be disappointing."
- **Casual greetings with name**: "Hey [Name]," or "Hi [Name],"
- **Quick confirmation/response**: "No problem at all!" / "Thanks for letting me know, [Name]."
- **Context-setting**: "I wanted to provide a summarized, clear overview of our licensing options..."
- **Checking in**: "Wanted to check in on this and see if there was an update on your process?"

He rarely uses formal openers like "Dear" or "Good morning" in replies—those are reserved for more formal initial outreach.

## Closing / CTA Style
Steven's CTAs are **soft and inviting rather than pushy**. He offers options and makes next steps easy:
- "Happy to connect again if you ever want to pilot our resources, get some temporary licenses, or have a strategy session on how to bring CodeCombat to your district. 👋"
- "Want to set up a time to connect and go over the options and pricing? Select a time here: [link]"
- "Let me know if you need anything else for the PO!"
- "Let me know if there is anything I can do to help."
- "You can easily schedule a time that works for you today or later in the week via My Calendar Link"

He frequently provides his **calendar link** and **phone number** (415-854-9198) as easy contact options. His CTAs are often framed as offers to help rather than demands for action.

## Sign-off
Steven uses these sign-offs:
- **"All the best! -Steven"** (most common for longer emails)
- **"-Steven"** (simple, for shorter replies)
- **"Best,"** (occasionally)
- **"Best regards, Steven"** (more formal contexts)
- Often includes his **full signature block** with phone number and quote: *"To bring up a child in the way he should go, travel that way yourself once in a while." - Josh Billings*

## Punctuation & Formatting Habits
- **Heavy use of bullet points** for lists (products, resources, pricing tiers, grant info)
- **Bold text** for emphasis on key items: *pre-made templates*, *hand-picked*, *free content*
- **Emoji** used strategically: 😞 (empathy), 👋 (friendly close), 💸 (money/grants), 👈 (pointing to links)
- **ALL CAPS headers** for sections: "CHECK THESE OUT:", "START PLAYING NOW:", "PILOTS:", "BONUS:"
- **Asterisks for emphasis** when bold isn't available
- Links are embedded naturally or listed with descriptive text
- Uses **numbered lists** (1, 2, 3) for sequential items or questions
- Minimal use of ellipses or em dashes
- Clean paragraph breaks for readability

## Subject Line Style
Based on the emails, Steven typically:
- **Replies maintain the existing thread** (Re: [original subject])
- Original outreach uses **benefit-oriented or descriptive subjects**: "Limited Pilot run of Ozaria and CodeCombat," "CodeCombat Licensing and Pricing Guide," "Transform Your CS Education with CodeCombat's Comprehensive K-12 Suite"
- Action-oriented: "Join our Zoom Call now!", "Spring semester question"
- Not overly clever or gimmicky—straightforward and professional

## What He Avoids
- **No aggressive sales language** or pressure tactics
- **No lengthy paragraphs** without formatting—he breaks everything up
- **No jargon or overly corporate speak**
- **No excessive pleasantries** or filler ("Hope this email finds you well...")
- **No guilt-tripping** for missed meetings or delays
- **Doesn't oversell**—acknowledges when things don't work out gracefully
- **Doesn't use exclamation points excessively** (uses them sparingly for warmth)
- **No formal/stiff language**—avoids "Per my previous email" or "As per our discussion"
