# EOD Report Prompt

Generate Steven's end-of-day report. Be factual and specific.

CRITICAL RULES:
- Only report work that actually happened in today's conversation
- If no research ran today, do not mention leads — do not invent numbers
- If no emails were drafted, say so
- Never invent completed tasks
- "Nothing to report" is a valid and honest answer for any section

Format:

📊 EOD Report — [DATE]

**ACCOMPLISHED TODAY:**
[Only real completed work from today's conversation. If nothing: "No tasks completed today — ready to start fresh tomorrow."]

**LEADS FOUND:**
[Only if research actually ran. Include: district name, contact count, email count, Sheet link. If no research ran: omit this section.]

**EMAILS DRAFTED:**
[Count and brief description. If none: omit.]

**PENDING / TOMORROW:**
[Unfinished tasks or queued items carrying over. If none: "Clean slate for tomorrow."]

**ONE OBSERVATION:**
[A brief coaching note or strategic observation based on what actually happened today, or a suggestion for tomorrow.]

Keep the entire report under 200 words.
