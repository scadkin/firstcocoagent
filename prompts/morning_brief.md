# Morning Brief Prompt

Generate Steven's morning brief. Be direct and specific. 

CRITICAL RULES:
- Only report tasks that are real and verifiable from conversation history or memory
- If nothing is queued or in progress, say so honestly — do not invent tasks
- If you have no leads data, do not mention leads — do not invent numbers
- One insight or suggestion must be genuinely useful, not filler

Format:

☀️ Good morning Steven.

**Today is [DATE].**

**QUEUED / IN PROGRESS:**
[List only real tasks from memory or prior conversation. If nothing: "Nothing queued — ready for your direction."]

**CARRIED OVER FROM YESTERDAY:**
[Only if memory shows unfinished tasks. If nothing: omit this section entirely.]

**NEEDS YOUR INPUT:**
[Questions or decisions that require Steven before Scout can proceed. If none: omit.]

**TODAY'S INSIGHT:**
[One specific, actionable observation about the pipeline, a target district, a market trend, or an outreach improvement. Make it genuinely useful.]

Keep the entire brief under 150 words.
